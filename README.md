# Exploratory vs Confirmatory Data Analysis

In this project, we are going to learn about two important data analysis methods EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and CDA (Confirmatory Data Analysis).

This project aims to emphasize the core skill of a data analyst: the ability to extract meaningful insights from data regardless of the specific business domain.

Here's why this is crucial:

Adaptability: In the real world, you'll encounter a wide variety of clients and industries. The ability to quickly adapt to new business contexts is essential.
Focus on Data Patterns: The core of data analysis lies in identifying patterns, trends, and relationships within the data itself.
Data-Driven Approach: By focusing on the data and its inherent characteristics, you can uncover valuable insights that might not be immediately apparent to someone with only business domain knowledge.

However:

Business Context Enhances Analysis: While it's possible to extract some insights without deep business knowledge, understanding the context significantly enhances the analysis. It allows you to:
Frame questions more effectively:
Interpret findings more accurately:
Provide more relevant and actionable recommendations.

Hence, EDA and CDA goes hand in hand.

The dataset we're going to work with is a dataset containing information about product sales in the U.S. The only thing we know about this dataset is that it's cleaned and ready to go.

Let's start with the usual loading of the datasets.

Once loaded up, let's come up with some questions on how to start our exploration:

Different column data types

How are the columns related

What are the different information in our data

Make a list of the information and start from the first row







Here are some key insights we can gather from the above:

There's a mix of profitable and unprofitable sales (notice the negative profit of -383.0310 for the Bretford table)
Some customers appear multiple times (e.g., Claire Gute, Sean O'Donnell) suggesting repeat business
The data spans multiple states and product categories, indicating a nationwide business with diverse product offerings
Order quantities are relatively small (2-5 units), suggesting this might be a B2C or small B2B business
The sales values vary significantly, from around $22 to $731, showing a wide price range in the product catalog
